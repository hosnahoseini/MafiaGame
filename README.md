# AP_midtermProject_spring_2021


My advanced programming course project for midterm, which is mafia game!

This game is written by java and mainly focus on client/server socket programming.

To play game you need to run "ServerMain" first and enter number of players(which should be more than 4) and then you have to run "ClientServer" for each player.

After assigning roles there are 3 main part: 1)chat[group chat for every alive players], 2)poll at the end of morning, 3)night and specific action for each role.

You can find more detail about game in "AP-Spring2021-MidtermProject.pdf"


Hope you enjoy!
